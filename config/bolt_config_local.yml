# Database setup. The driver can be either 'sqlite', 'mysql' or 'postgres'.
#
# For SQLite, only the databasename is required. However, MySQL and PostgreSQL
# also require 'username', 'password', and optionally 'host' ( and 'port' ) if the database
# server is not on the same host as the web server.
#
# If you're trying out Bolt, just keep it set to SQLite for now.
